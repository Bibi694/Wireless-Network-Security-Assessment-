# Wireless-Network-Security-Assessment-
ðŸ›¡ Wireless Network Security Assessment

ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project focuses on evaluating Wi-Fi network security, understanding how common wireless attacks work, and recommending strong protection strategies.
It was carried out in a controlled Kali Linux lab environment using virtual radios (mac80211_hwsim) to simulate Wi-Fi interfaces, since no physical USB adapter was available.

ðŸ§© Objective

To demonstrate key wireless security concepts including:
	â€¢	Capturing WPA2/WPA3 handshakes
	â€¢	Cracking weak Wi-Fi passwords using dictionary attacks
	â€¢	Exploring Rogue Access Point (Evil Twin) attack scenarios
	â€¢	Recommending secure configurations and preventive policies

âš™ Lab Setup

Environment: Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
Interfaces Simulated:
	â€¢	wlan0 â†’ Access Point (AP)
	â€¢	wlan1 â†’ Client/Victim
	â€¢	wlan2 â†’ Monitor Interface

Tools Used:
Aircrack-ng â€¢ Wireshark â€¢ Hostapd â€¢ wpa_supplicant â€¢ Python â€¢ mac80211_hwsim

ðŸ§  Tasks Performed

ðŸ§© Task 1 â€” WPA2 Handshake Capture
	â€¢	Created three virtual radios using mac80211_hwsim.
	â€¢	Configured wlan0 as AP, wlan1 as client, and wlan2 as monitor.
	â€¢	Captured the 4-way WPA handshake using airodump-ng.
	â€¢	Verified handshake in the .cap file.
